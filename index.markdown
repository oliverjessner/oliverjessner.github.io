title: Oliver Jessner Startup Enthusiast, Web fanatic, Free Education aficionado

<h1>Welcome to my personal website.<h2> 
This would be the elevator pitch about me: "I am a <strong>startup</strong> enthusiast, web fanatic, and a free education aficionado." 

I programmed in over 10 different programming languages but 
the language I love the most is <strong>JavaScript/NodeJS</strong>. Building <strong>startup</strong> is another passion of mine. All the fun and rough things you have to do to get started with a new business are the best parts for me. 

I am a strong believer in free education, we should <strong>not</strong> put information behind paywalls. Teaching is a big thing for me I mentored a 9 year old in programming, tutored a lot of school and university students, trained employees. Could not be more excited to learn and teach until I am 90 years old. If you want to read the short version of my story becoming a founder/developer/CEO, you can find it <a href="/story">here</a>.

My tiktok is not big but its full of developer enthusiasts, check it out if you want to see
my popular series <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@oliverjessner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Programmiermemes für nicht Programmierer erklärt"</a>.
