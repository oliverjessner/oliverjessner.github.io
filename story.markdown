<h1><i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-start"></i> Where do we start this story?</h1>
Let's go back to 2001, a much simpler time.
The young Oliver was <strong>10 years</strong> old and got his first personal computer. Back then,
we didn't have access to the web, so everything we learned, we learned through trial and error.

My best friend and I wanted to play games over the local network, so we had to learn the basics of networking. The first time in my life, I solved a real problem by doing <strong>something I love</strong>.

Fast-forward three years, I am <strong>fixing computer</strong> problems and building computers for friends and family. Helped my teachers teaching the basics of computer usage. 

Another year passed and I got my first access to the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>.
Finally discovering a new love, <strong>Social Media</strong> and the web.
At this time, I did not yet understand that this thing is going to play a big role in my life.
Important to note is that back then I found some really unpleasant <strong>Social Media</strong> networks full of hate and other illegal stuff. At the age of 14 I wrote my first simple websites, which was back then more impress than it's nowadays.

<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-school"></i> School</h2>
The next step in my life was attending a technical school and majoring in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong>. In this time, I really thought about studying <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> and going into robotics.
But in my last year I had to do a final project and I didn't know how to do robotics at home
without any experience. But the last year I learned myself some <strong>C#</strong> through books. I knew how to do desktop applications on Windows. My final project was building a management software for conveyance companies. With the help of the <strong>google maps API</strong>, I was able to 
simplify a lot of things. Sadly, such things as school projects aren't paid by the companies.

So I presented my software at a school competition and landed my first job. I was hired to write the fronted for a <strong>startup</strong>, which was founded by a later professor of mine. Furthermore, I wasn't hired as an employee, I had to found my first company a one-man business. So basically I freelanced for this <strong>startup</strong>. I learned a lot about <strong>startup</strong>s at this time. How to build and lead teams, and how to develop software on a larger scale. I did not learn because the made such a good job, no, I learned a lot because they made everything wrong. 

<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns"></i> College</h2>
I already joined college or, as we called here in old Austria, university. Of course,
I took Computer Science. My interests in robotics already faded away. However the first
years of college was pretty boring, most students don't even have the basic knowledge of programming. The next three years were full of ups and downs. College life wasn't my life.

Along the way I was still doing freelancing made some websites, did a bit of SEO, created custom cms and of course some <strong>Social Media</strong> marketing. Nothing of that was fascinating or impressive just basic good old work. I showed a big interest in garbage collection, made a presentation about the inner workings and algorithms in the <strong>V8</strong> engine of chrome. Wrote my first simple garbage collector in C. One of my professors asked if I want to do my bachelor thesis in garabge collection algorithms for google.

I was so happy, finally college offered something for myself that was tingling my spine. The only problem was I had not enough so called ETCS points. Its the first time in my life, where something was blocking my goals.

<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-building"></i> My first Startup</h2>
At this point I said fuck it, I hate college, I was not going to be happy doing this for another few years. So I made the only rational decision at this point. I closed my freelancing company, dropped out of college, and founded a new <strong>startup</strong> with one of my colleagues. The software was named Ganescha, to make things easier we named the company Ganescha Labs. Ganesha is the Indian god that destroys all obstacle in life. The same as I wanted to do with software, destroying obstacles. He was also the God of wealth, but we never told anyone 😉. I added the extra c to make SEO easier and avoided naming problems for Austrian company names. You are not allowed to name your company based on anything religious.

We started with doing <strong>Social Media</strong> bots, which generated automatically content on their own and grew followers. Three hundred followers a day, no problem. A few months later we learned, this is not allowed and is prohibited by nearly every <strong>Social Media</strong>. We rewrote everything and created a <strong>Social Media</strong> marketing software. My father was our first investor. A year later we got our second Investment by an Austrian company, a so-called seed investment. We hired two more people. We implemented 12 different <strong>Social Media</strong> APIs. Only one company on this earth had more partnership and <strong>APIs</strong> integrated as Ganescha Labs. Small hint the company was doing more than one billion in revenue at this time. The stack was basically a lot of NoSQL MongoDB and Redis, Microservices with <strong>Nodejs</strong>, a few image processing frameworks like sharp, jimp and some more. We did this for two years and burned fast through our cash. My co-founder left. We looked for a new way to sell software. 

In November 2020 a terrorist attack took place in Vienna. I can not go into full detail but the following happened. We took the core of Ganescha and created Beehive, a software that was a competitor to Palantir. Full of A.I and other things, Beehives destiny was to scan through all <strong>Social Media</strong> integrated in the Ganescha Core. We added a lot of messengers, added a one to one mirror to all image boards, we added an onion scrapper and a clearnet scrapper. We also reverse engineered all alt. right <strong>Social Medias</strong> like gab or getter. A lot of stuff was way more advanced than our competitors.

Beehive was the ultimate weapon to scan all <strong>Social Media</strong>. Got a few meetings with the Austrian Secret Service, talked to some political institutions. Set up a board of technical advisors and business angels. Talked to a lot of VCs. Applied some research assignment and other government subsidies. But everything was underpinned by one thing, more freaking cash. Our research assignment and government subsidies are only paid out if we could bring in a gigantic amount of money. Our business angels are only in if we could raise the money. Our last round was already burned, and the old investors wouldn't invest more. The funny thing was that everyone was ready to give us money if we could just raise a part of it. 

As a programmer I thought just brute force this problem. We need money, a lot of it. Business Angels don't have enough for Beehive so lets try VCs. We did VCs, which means we did 97 of them. 
Long story short, VCs are complicated and they don't like b2g (business to goverments). A few of them were very interested but all of them were very scared of the long sale cycles. We failed and we failed hard. This was the point were I had to close Ganescha Labs. My first Business child, my everything. One of the hardest things I ever had to do in my life. 

<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-crystal-ball"></i> My next step</h2>
But just a fews weeks after closing Ganescha Labs, I had a dream about a messenger. 
I pitched the idea to good friend of mine and we gave it the 
name <strong>Be8</strong>. Be8 is a self destructing End to End Encrypted privacy first messenger.
Programmed as a <strong>P</strong>rogressive <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>A</strong>pp equiped with a end to end encryption where no keys are leaving your device, Be8 is the way to communicate.
After 2 weeks we already got accepted at the microsoft founders hub. To be continued...

<strong>summary:</strong> 
Thanks for reading my story, I hope you enjoyed it.
I had to shorten a lot of stuff and things I couldn't mention,
due to contracts and due to personal security of people who are still
fighting againts radicalism. The main goal of this story was to focus on
the technical parts.
